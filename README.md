### Python Gmail API
The link below shows you how to get started and gives some sample code. Please note that the Gmail API is only supported for 2.7. Luckily in PyCharm, you can select different interperters for different scripts. Confused? As always, [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/23524553) has you covered.
